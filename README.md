# Tic Tac Toe Game
Here, I've used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develope a Tic Tac Toe game. 

• Tic Tac Toe Game: A 3x3 grid is used for the traditional paper and pencil game of tic tac toe. Two players alternately mark X and O in the grid's empty squares to play the game.

• Objective: Being the first player to line up three Xs or Os, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, is the aim of the game of tic tac toe. The game is deemed a tie if all the squares are filled but no player has made three consecutive wins.
